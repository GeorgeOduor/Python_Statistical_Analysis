Python statistics analysis projects

Here is a list of my data science projrcts in Python.

1.  [**Classification Algorithm with Logistic Regression.**(Data Analysis)](https://github.com/GeorgeOduor/Python_Statistical_Analysis/blob/master/projects/logisticreg/Classification%20Algorithm%20with%20Logistic%20Regression..md)

This project shows a thorough classification modelling with logisticregression in python.The project predicts whether an ad will be clicked by a user or not based on the features.Data is an advertising data collected by a team of data scientists over the year 2016.Click the above link to see more.

2.  [**CREATING A TIME SERIES FORECAST**](https://github.com/GeorgeOduor/Python_Statistical_Analysis/blob/master/projects/timeseries.md)-Transport industry

A transport company wants to invest in a new expensive service and they have to be sure on the revenue this service will earn in the next 18 months.To achieve this they want their passenger count to be predicted for the next seven months.Historical data showing passenger count per day per hour is provided.

3.  [**LOAN PREDICTION -FINANCIAL (XGBoost,Logistic Regression,Decission Trees,Random Forest**)](https://github.com/GeorgeOduor/Python_Statistical_Analysis/blob/master/projects/loanprediction%20notebook.md)

Loan approval is a very crucial part in any financial institutions.This project is aimed at predicting the loan aproval for clients based on their data such as applicant income,loan amount and others.
